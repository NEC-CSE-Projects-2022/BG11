## Abstract
Stroke remains a major global health concern, being
one of the top causes of mortality and a leading contributor to
long-term disability. This is the very reason why recognizing the
signs of risk is critical to treatment—timing is everything. In
this paper, we present a novel approach to assess the risk of
stroke using deep learning. The system is applied to real-world
healthcare datasets, which often exhibit a greater prevalence
of non-stroke cases compared to stroke cases. To address the
imbalance and enhance the data quality, we implemented several
data preparation steps, SMOTEENN, and a cross-validated deep
neural network model. We also applied transfer learning to
mitigate the impact of scarce data on model performance.
The model’s accuracy was assessed using the common metrics
of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The
outcomes were quite encouraging, achieving 95.24% accuracy
on average and 95.52% F1-score, confirming that the model is
extremely accurate. Apart from the outcomes, this study attempts
to solve significant real-world challenges such as the sparse nature
of stroke cases, data sparsity, and selection of relevant health
indicators. The findings indicate that deep learning approaches
are very effective, provided there is thorough data preparation
along with intelligent preprocessing.Feature selection can be an
impactful method for predicting stroke risk— potentially helping
doctors take action earlier and save lives.
